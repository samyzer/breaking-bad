                                                        magnate, and philanthropist. He was the respected proprietor of
                                                        Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful restaurant chain.
                                                        However, despite outward appearances, Gus was a major drug
                                                        kingpin initially affiliated with the Mexican Juárez Cartel,
                                                        secretly using his restaurant as a legitimate cover for
                                                        methamphetamine distribution throughout the American southwest.
                                                        Like Walter White, Gus was a criminal who "hid in plain sight",
                                                        using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature and

                    premiered on January 20, 2008. The series aired a total of 62 episodes, ending on September 29,

                <h1 class="paragraafTitel"> Plot </h1>
                <p class="paragraafTekst"> Walter White was a very ordinary, middle-class chemistry teacher, who also
                    worked a second job at a car wash in order to make enough money to feed his family. But one day, he
                    collapses, and is given a terrible diagnosis: stage-3 inoperable lung cancer. While watching the
                    news along with his family and friends on his 50th birthday, namely a segment on a methamphetamine
                    drug bust, he discovers the amount of profit in the meth business. His DEA agent brother-in-law Hank
                    Schrader offers Walter a ride-along to a methhouse sting. A while later, Walter accepts, and
                    accompanies Hank on a drug bust. While on the ride-along, he finds out that his former school
                    student Jesse Pinkman is part of the drug house operation, and watches him escape. As Walter
                    considers the financial benefits of drug trafficking for his pregnant wife Skyler, and his
                    physically disabled son, Walter Junior, he sees only one way out; forcing Jesse to teach him about
                    the drug trade. Using his chemistry knowledge, Walter ends up making the purest methamphetamine that
                    anyone has ever seen. Thus, both are drawn deeper and deeper into the abyss of organized drug
                    trafficking. </p>
                <p class="paragraafTekst" id="pagagraafTekst2"> Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Breaking Bad revolves
                    around Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher with a teenage son
                    who has cerebral palsy (RJ Mitte), and a pregnant wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn). When the already tense
                    White is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he breaks down and turns to a life of crime, producing
                    and selling crystal methamphetamine with his former student, Jesse (Aaron Paul), in a desire to
                    secure his family’s financial future while avoiding detection from his DEA agent brother-in-law,
                    Hank (Dean Norris). </p>
                <p class="paragraafTekst" id="pagagraafTekst3"> Breaking Bad has received widespread critical acclaim,
                    particularly for its writing and Cranston’s performance on the show, and has won several Emmy
                    Awards, including three consecutive Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series wins for Bryan Cranston as
                    well as an Outstanding Supporting Actor win for Aaron Paul. </p>
